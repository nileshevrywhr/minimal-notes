I'm currently working as a Security Researcher by day, and a hacker always... I hack technology, society & life everyday to understand how everything works, try to integrate what I find and improve quality of living. I have also held workshops and trainings to teach others about hacking & security. I post videos about my hacks & travels on YouTube. I also love playing video games like Watchdogs, GTA V, Assassin's Creed, BGMI, and Borderlands.

if you have an offer, opportunity or introduction that might make my life more interesting, e-mail me at nilesh [dot] guptain [at] gmail [dot] com. for the reasons stated above, i'll only respond to those proposals that are a good match for my schedule and interests.
