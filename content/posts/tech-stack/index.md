Did you ever get the error on Blinkist where it said there is something wrong with your internet connection? I didn't know any people who used Blinkist personally so I can't confirm but I've been getting the error for a week now. And that is why this app exists.(I later discovered this issue has been answered on their Help page as "re-installing the app")

static websites can also be created, that's how I found out about it when I was researching about static site generators for this website, and for a brief while i also considered building [TheDailyBlink](https://thedailyblink.ml) using Metalsmith but i dropped the idea bcoz MVP.
