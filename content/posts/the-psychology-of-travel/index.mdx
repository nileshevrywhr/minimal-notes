these are not well formed sentences but phrases, quotes, writings taken from various sources mixed with my own ramblings and applied in context of traveling. because that's how I think.

- you dont have to re-invent the wheel and travel somewhere new or do something completely off the charts - always remember... you are doing this for yourself - YOU choose what you want to do with your time - do not let algorithms of instagram, or other people wants dictate you decisions

- just note down & make a list of evrything, from names of places and activities other people are doing - no matter how luxurious, or pricey they look - do not hesitate - it's like copying from others in exam - jo mil rha, jaha se mil rha h, chaap lo - who knows teacher ko kya pasand aaye aur wo kiske number de de - (the teacher is Future You who's at the destination, looking for things to do) 

- and remember, you don't HAVE to do evrything on that list - you just want to have options, because that mindset is key - find out what other people are do and how they do it, and how you want to do it - and if this is your first time travelling, IMITATION IS THE GAME. 

- stop waiting, just start - you don't have to optimize costs and time right now - it might seem difficult to not optimize for some people, but you just need travel once. a full cycle, from plan to action - optimization comes later when you retrospect about areas in which you can improve, but you HAVE to go do it once - and when you do it once, and want to do it again? you will have plenty of time and attention to focus on optimizing  

- gather all the information you can from other people's travel stories and then try to recreate what they did - like an OSINT Investigator gathering info on their target, or pretty much how any stalker does it(finally, the hacker me awakens!) - OR, act like it a normal human being and ask them - where they stayed, what they did, how much did it cost 

- gentle reminder that it's not as scary & difficult as your mind makes it to be 

- when you're young, you can take lots of small risks, bcoz you have time to learn & recover from them - even if you lose some money on the first trip, you can make more later. if you get physically hurt, you have time to heal from it, try again better so you don't step on the wrong rock again.

- your brain is surprisigly good at detecting threats - in the event of a physical threat, the amygdala in your brain can jump to the fight-or-flight response, but the front lobes process the information you're receiving to help you determine if the danger is real. coming back through a forest, in heavy rainfall, and getting leeches stuck to your feet is NOT a threat - okay maybe the first time(it's an experience, i promise)

- you have to identify how much risk you're willing to handle and not take on more than that - smaller risk help you learn, and you shouldn't limit yourself to the comfort zone if you want to learn and grow as a human being

- here is a pattern, stability. we are stabilizing money, time, location which will eventually help stabilize our minds from all the chaos we need to pay attention to at any given moment. 

- remove the mental block that ask you, how will things work out? - take the first step and universe will help - and don't we want all the help we can get from the universe?! 

- even if you think you're stuck at one place and cannot travel, you still degrees of freedom, evryone has that - if you cannot travel bcoz of a demanding full-time job, plan a weekend getaway instead; restricted by parents, talk to them about visiting nearby places, where can you go?; not enough to finance a trip? save and invest first, start small and plan ahead - look for cheaper modes of travel, decent areas to stay - believe that it's possible, and you will find a way

- remember you are doing this bcoz you are a free human - not bcoz you saw over-glamorized travel reels on instagram, ACT by planning and then actually travelling instead of just doom-scrolling
